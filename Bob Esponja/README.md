## Bob Esponja (SpongeBob)

######Introduction:
The idea for this project was within code found on [Openprocessing](http://www.openprocessing.org), a sketch called Bob
Esponja, which is Portuguese for SpongeBob, based on the nickelodeon animated series. Designed by a user called Caetano,
the sketch was initially of only SpongeBobs house and a sketch of SpongeBob set to follow the mouse relative to it's
x and y co-ordinates. I have taken this example and adapted it in order to make it more usable as the original only 
really had one form of interactivity and didn't make use of the classes system in P5. 

######Methods:
To begin, I wanted to look at extending the original sketch to use the entire screen rather than just a box. To do so, 
I decided to refer to the spongebob television show and attempt to copy the layout of the street and attempt to sketch
the other houses. To do so, just by using basic sketching and draw tools 

I didn't really like the original colour of the background of the image so I wanted to change it to the image used in 
the show. To do so, I imported an image which I found on the internet and then set that to be the background instead of
a block colour. 

Now the design had been decided, I could begin working on making this into code which people would actually want to use,
to do so I genuinely began by watching episodes of the series for inspiration of what to add into the script. This began
with the presence of bubbles, which are seen much in the series, particularly to represent the presence of gas. So I set
up a 'bubbles' class which was set to draw whenever the mouse was clicked and held, causing a stream of bubbles to appear
at the opening of the chimney and begin to flow upwards and left to right with random direction and magnitude. Just to
add some form of basic interaction.


But this all left me with some quite basic looking code, a boring website which I wouldn't want to visit myself, so I 
thought about what might make this an interesting page and began designing a game. I took inspiration from code on 
[Openprocessing](http://www.openprocessing.org), a sketch called Dodge Catch which, in essence, is a game based on dodging
oncoming obstacles by a user operated point.
